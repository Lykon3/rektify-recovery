Every degen has the same cycle:

- Delete app
- Repeat tomorrow


But what if getting rekt could actually be... therapeutic?

3 personality modes:
🧘 Zen Stoic - "Loss is but a teacher"
💪 Alpha Chad - "HIT THE GYM BRO"
🤡 Clown Mode - "HONK HONK welcome to the circus"

## 🎯 Farcaster Launch Post


```
gm degens 🌅


I built REKTIFY because I noticed we all share the same toxic trading patterns but never talk about it


It's an AI therapy app that:
→ Diagnoses your worst trades
→ Generates cope memes automatically  
→ Tracks your degen patterns
→ Rewards the biggest losers


Think "Duolingo for not being a terrible trader"


The twist? There's a public Wall of Shame where everyone can see each other getting rekt in real-time. It's like group therapy but funnier.


Dr. Bags (the AI therapist) has 3 modes:
- Zen (for acceptance)
- Chad (for motivation)  
- Clown (for when you're beyond help)


Premium ($9/mo) adds wallet analysis that shows your recurring mistakes. Mine said "Chronic Discord Shill Victim" 💀


Try it: rektify.lol


First 100 comments get priority beta access to mobile app
```

## 🚨 Crisis Management 


**If someone says "This is mean":**
"We're building a supportive community through humor. Every feature is designed to help traders recognize patterns and improve. Plus, all sharing is voluntary!"


**If someone says "This could encourage trading":**
"Rektify actually helps identify destructive patterns. Our goal is harm reduction through self-awareness. Think of it as 'financial mindfulness.'"


**If someone's actually upset:**
"Hey, we hear you. Rektify includes real resources for anyone struggling. Check our /help page for actual financial wellness tools."
